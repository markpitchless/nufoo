nufoo - Command line boiler plate generator for developers.

e.g. to create a new HTML page:

 $ nufoo HTML.Page --title 'Hello'
 Info:    Created file 'index.html'

It has knowledge of common file layouts and will try to put created files in
the right places if they exist. e.g. create a new perl Moose class with a test,
run from the root of a perl project.

 $ nufoo Perl.Moose.Class --class Foo::Session --has Str:user_name --test_more
 Info:    Using perl dir '/projects/foo/lib'
 Info:    Using perl t dir '/projects/foo/t'
 Info:    Created directory 'lib/Foo'
 Info:    Created file 'lib/Foo/Session.pm'
 Info:    Created file 't/foo-session.t'

Comes with a library of various builders and an easy way to add your own both
locally from your home directory or per project by keeping them in the projects
file tree. Current builders:

 HTML.Page
 NuFoo.Builder
 OpenFrameworks.Starter
 Perl.Class.Plain
